    <!-- What is important is to look for the boxes on your webpage -->

    <!-- on the top we have the header 
    The HTML <header> element represents introductory content, typically a 
    group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading 
    elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements. -->

    <!-- give it a class of header for styling purposes later -->
    <!-- What do we have inside that header? -->

    <!-- insert code here -->

    <!-- Below the header what do we have ? -->
    <!-- We got the nav-bar, we can use a div and give it a class navbar for styling
    purposes in your css file later on-->
    <!-- The HTML <nav> element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide 
    navigation links, either within the current document or to other documents.  -->
    <!-- There are three links i.e a tags -->

    <!-- Links are essential in HTML, as the Web was initially designed to be an information 
    network of documents linked between each other. The “HyperText” part of HTML defines
    what kind of links we use: hypertext links, a.k.a hyperlinks.In HTML, links are inline 
    elements written with the <a> tag. The href attribute (hypertext reference) is used 
    to define the target of the link (where you navigate to when you click). -->

    <!-- Add three links in your div tag the last link give it a class of right -->

    <!-- insert code here -->

    <!-- Now below what we have is basically a row split in two boxes -->
    <!-- Lets create a div with class of row and inside that div let put two 
    divs on div class "side" and the other with class "main" -->

    <!-- Inside the div with class side what do we have? -->
    <!-- h2, h5, am image (let first put a div with class fakeimg) -->
    <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px">Image</div> -->
    <!-- Then we got some text , more text -->
    <!-- then three images -->

    <!-- insert code here -->

    <!-- Inside the main class  -->

    <!-- we have an h2, an h5, a div with class "fakeimg" -->
    <!-- <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200p">
          Image
        </div> -->
    <!-- some text , 2 succeeding p tags-->
    <!-- we can add a line break here <br/> tag -->
    <!-- then repeat it again -->

    <!-- insert code here -->

    <!-- Finally we have the footer -->
